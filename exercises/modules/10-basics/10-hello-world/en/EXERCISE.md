Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking “Run”.

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
Note that if you type `hello, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will count as different text, because upper and lowercase letters are different symbols in JavaScript. Letter size is called *case*, and any programmer will tell you that *case is important*. This rule affects almost everything in coding, so make sure you get used to paying close attention to the case at all times.
